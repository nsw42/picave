# PiCave

A Raspberry Pi-powered Personal Trainer for cyclists

(Cyclists often call their turbo trainer setup their 'pain cave' - hence the project name)

See <https://www.picave.org> for the main website.

See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md) for the quick summary of how to set up a Raspberry Pi to run this.

See [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for info about getting set up to contribute to development.
